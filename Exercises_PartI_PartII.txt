1-man is short for manual, 
  this command displays a specification of the use of the command that we want to know about
  and the flags that can be use with it. 
  As a windows user I have to use the --help command in the bash terminal

2-the -l flag is displays a long listing format wich means that shows more information about the files and folders.
  The -a flag displays ALL the files and folders even the hidden ones that start with .

3-file:///C:/Users/USER/Desktop/Migracode/google.html

8-You can go to the beggining of the line by pressing the home key

10-As I can understand the shell is the program/ app that runs the commands, inputs and outputs.
   The terminal is the program that interfaces with the shell.

11-The absolute path is the complete direction of a file or folder detailed from the root element.

12-A relative path is a portion of the absolute path, it's location is based in it's relation to the directory where it is linking.

13-A flag is an option for a command.
  For example we have the -r to recursive apply a command in a folder
  -v to show what the command is doing
  -a to show all, even hidden files or folders

14-							the -r flag is used to recursive remove a folder
   the -f flag is to force when there is a non existing file and arguments. 
      It was usefull when I wanted to delete a direct acces.
