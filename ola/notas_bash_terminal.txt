Terminal notes:

-echo $USER no me funciona igual que whoami

-bash doesn't allows me to use the man command, instead it tells me to use --help

-I can't navigate with the arrow keys when watching the manual, I have to use the scroll bar

-I don't know how to jump between words in the terminal

-what is the difference between the terminal and the shell?

-I don't know how to select and delete words without using backspace

-I don't know the difference between the shell and the terminal

-chmod command doesn't work when I want to change the permissions on first_folder,
  although when I use de -v flag it says that chmod works when I check it again with ls -lah 
  the folder still has the same permissions than before
